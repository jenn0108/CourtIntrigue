Trial Idea
---------------
- Count appoints 3 judges (count can be one of them)
- "evidence" is presented by characters.  Evidence is positive or negative.
	- Positive or negative depends on whether or not the character likes the
	  defendent better than the judges/accuser.
- judges render verdict based loosly on evidence and whether they like the
  defendent or accuser better.
- traits like just would affect the the judges decision based on evidence.

First Impression Idea
----------------------
A timed opinion modifier can be created when a character first meets another
that is basically whatever opinion they have at the moment (based on things
like traits and family modifiers).  Some multiple of the initial opinion can
be added as a first impression modifier.  So, if they have a -10 from traits,
a -30 first impression could be added.  The first impression could slowly
degrade over time.
